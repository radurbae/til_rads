Have you ever wondered who succeeds in this life? And why do they succeed?

I came across a video by Professor Jiang on YouTube that contains his lecture for Beijing high school students. Found that the video was very interesting, so I decided to write something about it. Hope it inspires you.

Back then, an experiment was conducted by Walter Mitchell, it's a popular experiment called "Marshmallow Test" which involved some kids around four years old and five years old to take part. They would be given a marshmallow each, and they promised them to add one more marshmallow if the kids could wait for a little longer. Later on, he followed the kids in their lives and found out that the kids who were able to resist the urge to eat a marshmallow to get more later have a better life than the kids who do the opposite.

They called it "Delayed Gratification", or we can simply call it Self-Control, signs that the kids who can control themselves can do long-term planning and have good emotional regulation. This concluded the first characteristic of successful people, self-control.

Second, Carol Dwight wrote a book titled Mindset, and found out there are two types of mindsets: Growth and Fixed Mindset. A growth mindset means that if people stumble upon something or fail at something, they will think that this is their chance to grow and never give up, no matter what the outcome will be. The opposite, a fixed mindset, means a different reaction; they just give up, nothing else.

In simpler words, it's Resilience. The ability to resist any condition they face, no matter how hard it will be.

Third, the book by K. Anders Ericsson titled Peak states that people who can achieve the pinnacle of something, or success, have the same trait. It was Deliberate Practice, or they practice strategically. What are the goals? How to achieve it? And how to improve it?. Basically, we can call it Self-Reflection or Self-Assessment.

It has relations with an experiment conducted by psychologists Dunning and Kruger back then. They assess some people on IQ tests. After the test, they asked the people about the prediction of their result, and found out later that the lowest performers assessed their result was higher than their ability. The stupid one lacks metacognitive abilities, which means they don't have Self-Assessment. And the opposite, the top performers answered that their result was slightly lower than what they actually could have. Which turns out to be the opposite of the stupid one.

There is a saying that the hardest part of being a student is assessing yourself properly. To know exactly where you stand and how to improve. Those who are stupid are often the most confident in the world.

And as educators, what we can do is to develop strategies and a curriculum to help all students succeed. But it does not always work.

Now we know the traits of successful people;

1. undefined
2. undefined
3. undefined

Now, the problem is Correlation ≠** **Causation. So, success isn't guaranteed by those traits. Rather than those traits, wealth and stability drive more.

Rich people are more likely to succeed than poor people. Even later on, the macroeconomics studies found out that school doesn't really matter.

Basically, it lies in their parenting strategies.

The first major difference in their parenting strategies is in the vocabulary they used to communicate with their child. Rich parents use a higher vocabulary and explain what the world is to their child by longer sentences and explanations, while poor parents have a lower vocabulary than the rich ones (No, Yes, Go Away, etc.).

Another major difference is in attitude. So, rich parents use a friendly attitude, while poor parents use an authoritarian or command attitude.

Example:

When rich kids touch the stove, their parents say, "Don't touch it, kid. Why? Because it is hot and you will burn yourself if you touch it, and if that happens, we will be sad."

The opposite for the poor kids, their parents immediately yelled at them and were angry with them. They will say, "Why do you act like that? Don't you dare to touch it, or I'll be angrier with you!"

Pretty simple, right? But it will make a difference in their minds. Rich kids will understand that the world is safe and that they are respected in this world. While the poor ones will think that the world is scary, or they will be afraid of adults. This will build fear and avoidance, also killing resilience. Even if it seems effective, the problem is that it creates stress in the family and makes the child feel unsafe.

The third major difference is that rich parents offer stability, while the others offer volatility. The simplest example is that rich parents are able to keep promises while others aren't.

How does it affect those theories I explained before?

The Marshmallow test isn't a test for self-control, but rather a test of your trust in others; it's your belief and trust in authoritative figures.

Back to stability, if your parents are rich, you have stability, and you can wait a little longer to get two marshmallows. But if your parents are poor, you don't have stability, so you are better off eating that marshmallow rather than waiting for that uncertain additional marshmallow.

Poor kid isn't stupid; they are rational, and they are responding to the circumstances they live in.

Second, resilience. Resilience is a byproduct of safety. You are resilient because you are safe enough to fail without being destroyed, and you believe that the world will help you. If you are rich, your cost of failure is low, and you can fail forward and be resilient enough. But if you are poor, your cost of failure is catastrophic; you can't afford to take risks. And you don't have the belief that the world will help you. So, you don't have much confidence in others.

Now, self-assessment or self-reflection. Instrospection or evaluation was painful, and if you are poor, when you look inward, all you've got is pain, stress, and fear.

Based on these parenting differences. If you conclude that schools should focus on better parenting skills, you aren't wrong. But, it won't work either because Prof Jiang said it was too late, a lot of their worldview was established. So, how about changing parent behaviour? It won't work either; it will be Mission Impossible.

No matter what we do, the rich become rich, and the poor become poor.

Why is this the case? I'll continue it on the next occasion.
