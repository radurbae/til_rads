# *Cognitive Biases are predictable weaknesses in the ways we've evolved to think.*

Our brains are very good at recognizing patterns. Why? because it is very useful for survival.

Our highly evolved pattern recognition skills allowed our brains to apply a mental shortcut, which is known as Heuristic. It is the mental shortcut that helps us solve problems quickly and make life livable.

The so-called heuristic is the brain's way of copy-pasting stories we already have onto new information so that we don't expend a bunch of brain power in every direction all the time.

Cognitive Bias happens unconsciously, when our decision-making is influenced by beliefs and patterns we aren't aware of.

Here are some examples of biases :

For efficiency, our brains often put more weight on the most readily "*available*" information around. It's also what we called by Availability Bias. When people make judgments based on the information that's easily available.

Confirmation Bias is our brain's tendency to accept information that agrees with things we already believe.

Anchoring Bias is how we cling to the first impression.

Hindsight Bias is how we tend to believe the events of the past were predictable.

## How to overcome biases? It's where science takes part.

Science is the system used to interrogate the universe. It is a way of building knowledge that's durable, communal, and long-lasting.

The process of science is actually designed to overcome biases, from methods, to reliance on evidence, and especially the fact that science is communal. It is get vetted by a whole community.

## You can watch out for cognitive biases in your own thinking too.

One of the easiest and most important things you can do to fight back against bias is just understanding that it's real, and accepting that you have it.

Being aware of bias gives you the chance to look out for its influence on your decisions.

Another way is to interact with lot of people, especially people who are different from you. Bias likes to tell that our experience is the only reality. But, to really understand the world, we need community.

Another way is to have Cognitive Flexibility. It is your ability to imagine options or explanations beyond your gut reaction. On another words, to question what you already know.
