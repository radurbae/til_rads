Let's continue our conversation.

I've explained the characteristics of successful people before and the parenting differences between rich and poor families.

Is this system aren't gonna changed? Or will it last forever?

Prof. Jiang said that changes are difficult to make— we call it social mobility. Even if it happened, it requires a lot of effort and dedication.

For a poor person to achieve social mobility, there are a few high-risk paths:

### Abandoning your community

Remaining in a low-opportunity environment—even if it is safe and familiar- guarantees a "low ceiling" for success. To break this pattern, one must move into a high-opportunity environment, which requires a painful trade-off: *stability for possibility.*

This path is high risk because you will need to be "extremely individualistic". You have to sever ties with the safety net of your family, friends, and culture, to enter a system where you might fail completely. Most people rationally choose the safety of being in a community rather than the loneliness of a high-risk opportunity.

### Marrying Up

This way has proven its effectiveness throughout history. It is a historical mechanism for rising in society (the other being war). And frankly to say marriage is a market transaction that involves status.

### War and Revolution

In stable times, hierarchies are rigid. War is described as a chaotic event that temporarily breaks the "*zero-sum*" deadlock of elite overproduction, allowing new players to rise based on immediate merit (survival and combat) rather than lineage. Elite Overproduction is a destabilizing phenomenon that occurs when a society produces more wealthy, educated, and ambitious individuals than there are positions of power to accommodate them.

### Luck

Here, luck isn't a random magic, but described as a calculable element of strategy or strategic positioning. While you can't force success, you can manipulate your environment to increase the mathematical probability of a "lucky" event occurring.

Here is what Prof Jiang explained:

**Geography is Destiny**

You must physically move to where the volatility (and therefore the opportunity) exists. You cannot get "lucky" in a stagnant room.

**Luck Looks Like "Who," Not "What"**

"Luck" usually manifests as benevolent authority—a specific person with power deciding to help you. Hard work alone is useless if no one sees it. Luck is when a powerful person notices your hard work and says, *"Wow, you're a really hard worker, I want to promote you"*. You must position yourself in rooms, industries, or cities where these "powerful decision-makers" actually exist. If you work hard in a factory with no upward mobility, your hard work has a 0% chance of triggering this specific type of luck.

**Hard Work is just the "Entry Fee"**

Hard work won't cause success. Hard work is simply the prerequisite to be eligible for luck. The logic behind it is that you work hard so that if the opportunity presents itself (if the lightning strikes), you are ready to seize it. And remember, *"Just because you work hard... does not mean you'll succeed"*. Hard work buys you a ticket to the lottery, but it doesn't guarantee a win.

Okay, enough for this topic, see ya in my next writing.
