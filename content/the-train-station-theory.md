# Can you imagine that every relationship we have in our life is just like a train station?

i've never thought it was before until now. Why people around me fading away like nothing, seems like i am unimportant, that thought was lingered on my mind past few days.

it was never a coincidence. like hard splash of water on my face, this theory refresh my mind. it's wasn't proved psychologically but it's relates on modern conversation.

every relationship we have in our life is just like a train station. we're just passengers waiting in the station, and every relationship is a train. we don't decide the timetable, it will comes whether we're ready or not and it'll goes whether we're ready or not. and people in our life, they're same passenger like us.

we get to know them, we made bond with them, even falling in love with them, but every passenger wait for it train. when the train arrives, they will leave us, whether we're ready or not. maybe we can board the same train but the harsh truth is the fact that they're still uncertain. they can accompanied us for the rest of the journey, through dark tunnel or they will leave at the next station and leave us empty.

so when we lose friends, **it doesn't mean we were bad friends**, no, it's not. we were just two people standing at the same platform and our train have different timetables or two people sitting on the same train waiting for the station we get off and wait for the next train to next destination.

sometimes we meet the person with the same vibes with us and perfectly compatible with your personality, but it doesn't mean we will board the same train or it doesn't guarantee that person will be with us for the rest of our journey.

timing wasn't the only factor. it's as vital as the bond itself. if you miss the chance to be in relationship, a.k.a to board the train, the train will moves on, and you don't jump onto the track to chase it and you just simply wait for the next train.

the train theory teaches us that when people get off of my life, it wasn't personal. it's simply as they've just reached their stop. this theory help us to let people go without resentment.

*that train has left the station, but it's okay. the platform will never left empty for too long, sooner or later, train arrives and we decide to board it or let it pass.* and if we decide to board it, no matter it express or local trains, it eventually leads us to the next station or maybe it will get us to our final journey. and still feel excited for people we'll meet in our journey or even in the next station and train.
